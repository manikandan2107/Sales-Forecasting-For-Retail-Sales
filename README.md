SALES FORECASTING FOR RETAIL SALES
This project involves the analysis and prediction of weekly sales data for a retail store chain. The dataset includes information about store features, sales, and store types. The project follows a structured approach, including data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning modeling.

Key Steps:

data Collecting:The dataset includes information about store features, sales, and store types which isin csv file

Data Exploration: The project starts with data exploration to understand the structure and features of the datasets. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques such as summary statistics, correlation analysis, and visualization are used to gain insights into the data.

Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering. Techniques like label encoding, handling outliers, and transforming date variables are applied to prepare the data for modeling.

Machine Learning Modeling: Several regression models are trained on the preprocessed data to predict weekly sales. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as R^2 score,Mean Absolute Errorand Mean Squared Error (MSE). The best-performing model, Random Forest Regressor, is serialized and saved for future use.

Conclusion:
Overall, this project demonstrates the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to solve real-world business problems, such as sales forecasting for retail stores.
